# esphome-rego600
Started as a fork of [Husdata H60 Arduino get started code](https://github.com/peterarandis/H60-OS) but it is now broken out as stand-alone custom component. Used a lot of influence from the following projects:
  - [esphome/components/dsmr](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/dev/esphome/components/dsmr) (how to combide a back-bone service and different types of child entities)
  - [stream server for ESPHome](https://github.com/oxan/esphome-stream-server/) (how to create a service communicating over UART)
  - [custom component esphome-rego1000](https://github.com/jagheterfredrik/esphome-rego1000) (a related integration, have been trying to keep external design as similar as possible)
  - [how to connect heat pump with Rego 6xx controller](https://rago600.sourceforge.net/) (a lot of information about the Rego600 interface)
  - [openhab addons](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/tree/main/bundles/org.openhab.binding.regoheatpump) [mappings](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/blob/main/bundles/org.openhab.binding.regoheatpump/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/regoheatpump/internal/rego6xx/RegoRegisterMapper.java) (SW implementation for the interface)

To be used as custom component to ESPHome

Planned functions:
  - (done) Wifi connection with DHCP and fixed SSID/PASS
  - (done) Web page showing status and heat pump data (ESPHome)
  - (untested) Communication with heat pump via ESPHome UART component
  - Provide input and output entities based on heat-pump model

Add the following to your ESPHome config

All entities are extendable with normal additional attrubutes as "unit_of_measurement", "state_class" etc.

An as complete as possible configuration package as possible is provided in [rego600.yaml](rego600.yaml)

```

Currently there is no compiled list of registers to be used, but can get a lot from the tables here (https://rago600.sourceforge.net/#SW), also copird to [constants.h](https://github.com/dala318/esphome-rego600/blob/master/components/rego600/constants.h) but not used. When up and working it might be a good idea to prepare these type of templates [rego1000-v3.7.0.yaml](https://github.com/jagheterfredrik/esphome-rego1000/blob/main/rego1000-v3.7.0.yaml)

For debugging it's suggested to also add a [stream server](https://github.com/oxan/esphome-stream-server) to your config for direct connection between your PC and heat-pump
